					<p><span>📔 Hi there! I'm Rachel and I study politics and sociology at <a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/"> Mount Holyoke College</a>. 
						In my coursework and research, I enjoy learning about the ways that economic capital informs cultural privilege and trajectories. 
						I spend a lot of time thinking about how to make critical spaces of upward mobility more equal and accessible. </span></p>
				    <p> ✏️ This semester, I'm working on a new research project through the Sociology department. My research examines the political affiliations of Evangelical Christians 
					    through a Durkheimian lens. It focuses on the experience of religious ritualism and links post-rationalist religiosity with Donald Trump's performance politics.<p>
					
			<p> 💼 Later this year, I'll be starting as a software engineer at a financial services firm. 
				In the past, I’ve worked for Amazon Web Services and my college’s philanthropic arm, 
				The Mount Holyoke Fund, in marketing roles. For more on my background and skill set, 
				see my <a href="updated formatted resume.pdf">resume</a>.<p>
            
          <p>✨ In my free time, I love reading (current favorite book is City of Girls by Elizabeth Gilbert), going to trivia night with friends, and bamboozling myself with sudoku puzzles.<p>
